# data_team

In this repository we keep all public info regarding the various teams in the ThreeFold Movement and FreeFlow Nation.
Every person in our organisation can add himself to this repository following the 6 steps below.

1. Create a new folder in the [team directory](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/data_team/tree/master/team). The directory needs to feature the full name of the team member using '_' for spaces e.g. kristof_de_spiegeleer, owen_kemp,  etc.
2. Copy the contents of [publicinfo-template.toml](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/data_team/blob/master/publicinfo-template.toml). 
3. Create a new file called 'publicinfo.toml' and paste in the contents of the template file.
4. Fill in the data in the toml file according to your situation.
5. Upload a picture you are ok with to share on our various websites.
6. When your data and picture is added please create an issue in the repo to "clean up" your picture if this is not yet done. So we can remove the background and all have the similar looking pictures.
