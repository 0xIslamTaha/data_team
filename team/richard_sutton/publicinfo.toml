description = "Richard is a business-builder, creative and an esoteric cosmologist. He has a 30-year career founded in the automobile business, first as writer and publisher, then as electronic media entrepreneur, and moreover as an international event promoter, showman and brand-builder. He has worked with a wide variety of heritage brands, mostly in the high-end and auto sectors, but does so as an ardent protector of our environment and nurturer of right-action."
why_threefold = "I am thrilled by everything ThreeFold Foundation stands for and promises to be. The bright-eyed skills and gravitas of its creators and executors; the neatness and purity of its vision and form; its sustainability and neutrality; and its foundational mission to contribute. ThreeFold Foundation is a trail-blazing example of a higher state of consciousness in business. Itâ€™s a shaft of light in a tortured, still descending world and a manifestation of something genius."
